# 📊 Student Rank Predictor

This project is a **Student Rank Predictor** based on **NEET quiz performance**. It analyzes quiz performance data, generates insights, and predicts ranks using historical data. Additionally, it provides **topic-wise performance analysis, weak area identification, and improvement trends**.  

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Performance Analysis** – Computes accuracy, topic-wise performance, strengths, and weak areas.  
✅ **Weak Areas Identification** – Identifies topics where students struggle the most and suggests improvements.  
✅ **Improvement Trends** – Tracks quiz performance over time to observe trends in accuracy, speed, and scores.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Data Handling**: Axios (for fetching historical quiz data)  
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
